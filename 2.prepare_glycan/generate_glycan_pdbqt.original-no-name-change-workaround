# Generate the pdbqt for a glycan
USAGE="""
Usage:

    $0 <option>

    Where option is one of the integers: 1 2 3

    1: The glycan is fully rigid.
    2: The glycan is partially flexible.
    3: The glycan is fully flexible.

    The script expects to find a file called 'glycan.pdb' in the directory from which it is called.

    It will write out a file called 'ligand.pdbqt'.
